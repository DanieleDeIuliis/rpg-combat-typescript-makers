## Iteration Four ##

1. Characters may belong to one or more Factions.
    - Newly created Characters belong to no Faction.

2. A Character may Join or Leave one or more Factions.

3. Players belonging to the same Faction are considered Allies.

4. Allies cannot Deal Damage to one another.

5. Allies can Heal one another.

## Iteration Five ##

1. Characters can damage non-character *things* (props).
    - Anything that has Health may be a target
    - These things cannot be Healed and they do not Deal Damage
    - These things do not belong to Factions; they are neutral
    - When reduced to 0 Health, things are *Destroyed*
    - As an example, you may create a Tree with 2000 Health

## Retrospective ##

- Have the tests changed from iteration to iteration? Why?
- Was implementing the Faction rules easy or hard compared to the previous iterations?
- How did you handle the new requirements? Did you need to change your design?
- How would you tackle this problem again? Why?
